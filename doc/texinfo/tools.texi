@chapter Tooling

The smart contract tests are implemented using a convenience library based on the chainlib-eth python module.

It also provides two CLI tools:

@itemize @var
@item craftnft-publish
Create a new token.
@item craftnft-dump
List all minted tokens and their ownership status.
@item craftnft-allocate
Allocate a new set of tokens for a particular token definition.
@item craftnft-mint
Mint a new token from an existing allocation.
@end itemize

The tooling is itself provided as a python module. It can be installed from pypi.org under the name craft\_nft, e.g. pip install craft\_nft. If your executables path are correctly set, the tools will be directly executable in the shell.
